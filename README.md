##The Hotel Mobile App##

#MAD Mini Project#



“Hotel Booking” is a mobile app that facilitates online booking. The user can book rooms for accommodation and book for events such as “High Tea” events and buffets. This application enables user to conveniently make bookings without having to physically visit the hotel premises. First and foremost, the user must login into their account or sign in, if the application is used for the first time. As usual, certain credentials are needed to be provided for any login and sign in. In addition, this application uses fingerprint scanning for the login as a convenient approach for logging in. The user can edit profile details and logout from their accounts. The user can book a hotel room by entering the necessary details such as check-in and check-out dates, number of adults and number of children. In the same way, the user can make a booking for an event by giving the date of the event and the number of guests attending. The booking history, containing all the bookings made by the user, can be viewed. Users are able to give feedbacks about their experience with the app and rate accordingly. To make payments simpler, the user is able to keep his/her card details saved so whenever payment is made, the card details are automatically fetched and displayed and the user can add new card details, update them and delete the existing card details as required and select the card that should be currently in use.
